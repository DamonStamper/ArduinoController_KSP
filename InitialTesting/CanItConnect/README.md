0. Upload https://github.com/cardy64/ksp-controller/blob/cd409729e335bcae6965e7676d88f2ac10e5f1c1/ksp-controller.ino to your Arduno, 
0. Plug the Arduino in, 
0. Start the kRPC server, 
0. Confirm that above the "start" button in kRPC it says "KSP controller @ COMx". 
	I also noted that the 
		- tx and rx LEDs on the Ardino Nano were flashing rapidly
		- "show info" button in the kRPC window was showing data being read/written to as a constantly changing number
		- the radial button next to "Milo's KSP controller @ COMx" was rapidly changing from green to black.
